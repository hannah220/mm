## Matrix Multiplication

* Task 1/2/3: Matrix multiplicaiton using standard algorithm 
  * Compile/execute matrixmult.cpp to multiply N * M matrices of your choice
  
* Task 4: Matrix multiplicaiton using SIMD
  * Compile/execute simd_big_matrixmult.cpp to multiply arbitrary N * N matrices where N range from 2 to 10^5. 

* Bonus: Matrix multiplicaiton using Devide and Conquer strategy 
  * Compile/execute dac.cpp to multiply arbitrary N * N matrices where N is 2^n, n ranging from 4 to 16.
  
* Result:
